# About the project
This project is a web application designed to make managing Manager-Worker meetings easier. Additionally, it was made to teach basics of ASP.NET Core MVC, 
Linq library, and Razor Pages. It served as a practical guide under the mentor's supervision during an internship. However, after the internship has finished, 
the project remained incomplete. Motivated to learn more and enhance my skills, I took the initiative to complete the project. During that time i have used 
jQuery and enhanced my skills even more.
